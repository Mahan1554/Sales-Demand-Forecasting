# Sales-Demand-Forecasting
This project leverages machine learning models to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales trends. We employ XGBoost Regression, a powerful ensemble learning method that can model complex, non-linear relationships in the data. This approach helps us understand interactions between different features and improve prediction accuracy.
